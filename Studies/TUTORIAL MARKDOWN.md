**Headings:** To create a heading, simply type # followed by the heading text. The number of # symbols you use will determine the size of the heading. For example, ## heading will create a level two heading, while ### heading will create a level three heading.

**Bold/Italics:** To create bold or italicized text, simply surround the text with asterisks or underscores. For example, **this text is bold** and _this text is italicized_.

**Links:** We’ve already gone over wiki-style links. To create a link, simply type the link text in square brackets [] and then the URL of the link in parentheses (). For example, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/obsidian.md) will create a link to your Obsidian app. If you have trouble remembering this, you can always use a keyboard shortcut (cmd/ctrl+k) or the [Paste URL into Selection plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection).

**Lists:** There are two types of lists in Markdown—ordered and unordered.

An ordered list is created by typing a number followed by a period for each item in the list. For example:

```
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
```

To create an unordered list, simply use asterisks (*) or minus signs (-) instead of numbers. For example:

```
* Item one
* Item two
* Item three
```

**Blockquotes:** To create a blockquote, simply type > before each line of the quote. For example:

```
> The problem with internet quotes is that you cannot always depend on their accuracy.
> --Abraham Lincoln
``` 

**Code Blocks**: You can use code blocks by using backticks (`). Use a single backtick for inline code, or three backticks for chunks of code. [Learn more about code blocks](https://obsidian.rocks/the-obsidian-code-block/).
