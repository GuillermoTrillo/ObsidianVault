You can configure Git at:

- [[System]]: For every single user in the computer.
- [[Global]]: For all repositories of the current user.
- [[Local]]: The current repository.

When changing the configuration, you shall write "config" right after "git". For example:
 
#git #config #--global _user.name_

first, the #git command, that says I'm specifically doing a git command. Then, #config, which says it is related to configurating Git. The #--global specifies that it is a command for all the repositories of the current user. Then, _user-name_ is the last command, that specifies you are going to change the git's user name.
