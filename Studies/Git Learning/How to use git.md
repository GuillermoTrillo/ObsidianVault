There are multiple ways of using git.

- With the command line;
- Code editors have base support to use it (GitLens extension to VSCode);
- Graphical user interfaces specifically made for Git (GitKraken or SourceTree);
The most interesting one to learn and use is the command line, as there are certain limitations for specific cases with both the code editors' extensions and with the GUIs.

Using Git BASH is the most interesting way of doing so.
