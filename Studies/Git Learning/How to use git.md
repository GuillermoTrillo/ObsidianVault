There are multiple ways of using git.

- With the command line;
- Code editors have base support to use it (GitLens extension to VSCode);
- Graphical user interfaces specifically made for Git (GitKraken or SourceTree);
The most interesting one to learn and use is the command line, as there are certain limitations for specific cases with both the code editors' extensions and with the GUIs.

Using Git BASH is the most interesting way of doing so.

An example of a git command line is:

#git #config #--global _user.name_

First, the #git command, that says I'm specifically doing a git command. Then, #config, which says it is related to configurating Git. The #--global specifies that it is a command for all the repositories of the current user. Then, _user-name_ is the last command, that specifies you are going to change the git's user name.
