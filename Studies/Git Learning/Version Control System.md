A system that records changes made to our code into "Repositories". Repositories save who made the changes, why they made them, how they made them, and what exactly was changed. They are great for multiple-people projects, as it also allows for various changes to merge together perfectly.
They are divided in two caterogies: Centralized and Distributed.

**Centralized:** All team members connect to a central server, to share changes and such. This has a problem: if the server goes offline, nobody can collaborate to the project.

**Distributed:** All team members have a copy of the project in their own machines. If the server goes offline, we can simply connect the project with other team members.
